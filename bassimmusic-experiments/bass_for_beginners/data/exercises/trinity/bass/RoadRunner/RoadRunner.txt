Name: RoadRunner
Type: Bassline
Description:Two technical elements are featured in this song:
• Syncopation
• Articulation
Syncopation appears mainly in the intro. Aim for precision here, and play
melodically, which will provide contrast with the repeated notes that make up the
next section. Articulation is important throughout — especially in accented notes at
end of the intro (and where this material returns) and in the verse. Here, the tenuto
markings suggest a full-length, slightly emphasised note, while the brackets suggest
an underemphasised or ‘ghosted’ note.
