Name: Yellow

Description:Two technical elements are featured in this song:
• Repeated notes
• Syncopation
The tempo isn’t too fast, so keep a steady grip on the repeated notes in the intro
and verse to avoid a rushed feel and do your best to play them evenly. The chorus
features a new rhythm with syncopation, so count carefully and aim for accuracy
here.
