browneyedgirl7,"Good overall ""Note Onset Security"" but with some hesitation and rhythmic issues. ",There are many notes that should last a little longer so that the bass line would have more presence. ,Little sonic presence of the bass (partly due to sound quality). ,12,19,11,42,3,
browneyedgirl8,"At the beginning there is an irregular but passable rhythmic precision. However, in the last bars where we can hear the bass, there are too many rhythmic hesitations. ",Some notes could use a little more duration.,"Sound - Problems with fretting and sound quality. 
Accuracy - The groove is not quite clear and that makes for too much hesitation.
It is important to finish the song, even if we get lost, we must follow the song and try to play it again.",28,8,45,81,1,"    ""Negative"",
