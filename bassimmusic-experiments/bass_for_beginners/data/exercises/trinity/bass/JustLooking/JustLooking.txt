Name: Just Looking
Type: Bassline
Description:The Technical Elements to focus on are
• Accented syncopation
• Dynamics
The signature riff of this song appears at the chorus, where the bass plays an
accented, syncopated motif. You’ll need to play with complete precision and a
hard accent on the two notes where this is written. There is also a wide range
of dynamics to observe, including an unexpected subito p at bar 25. These are
important for the drama of the song, so aim for maximum contrast between
soft and loud.
